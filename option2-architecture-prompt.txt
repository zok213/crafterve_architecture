   - Error Handling & Retry Logic

3. **AI Generation Layer**
   - Replicate API Gateway
   - GPU-accelerated Model Inference
   - Stable Diffusion XL Processing
   - Automatic Model Updates
   - Usage Monitoring & Billing

4. **Caching & Storage Layer**

   - Session Management
   - Performance Optimization

5. **Delivery & Monitoring Layer**
   - AWS S3 Storage
   - CloudFlare CDN Distribution
   - AWS CloudWatch Monitoring
   - Performance Metrics & Alerts

### VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:

**üé® Color Scheme:**
- Replicate API: Green (#27ae60)
- AWS Services: Orange (#f39c12)
- CloudFlare CDN: Blue (#3498db)
- Monitoring: Gray (#95a5a6)
- Storage: Purple (#9b59b6)
- User layer: Cyan (#17a2b8)

**üìä Component Details:**
- **Replicate API:** "$0.0023/image, GPU acceleration included"
- **AWS SQS:** "1M requests free tier eligible"
- **ElastiCache:** "t3.micro instance, 1GB cache, 20GB storage"
- **S3 Storage:** "Standard tier, 100GB storage, 100K GET requests"
- **CloudFlare CDN:** "Free tier, 100GB bandwidth"
- **CloudWatch:** "Free tier: 1M metrics, 100K alarms"

**üîÑ Data Flow:**
1. User submits weapon generation prompt via game interface
2. Load balancer directs to Crafterse backend API
3. Backend validates request and authentication
4. Request queued in AWS SQS for processing
5. SQS triggers Replicate API model inference
6. GPU-accelerated Stable Diffusion generates image
7. Generated asset cached in ElastiCache (Redis)
8. Asset stored in AWS S3 with lifecycle policies
9. CloudFlare CDN distributes globally
10. CloudWatch monitors performance and costs
11. Success response with asset URL returned to user

**üìà Performance Metrics:**
- Generation Speed: 15-30s (GPU-accelerated)
- Throughput: 1,000-2,000 images/hour
- Premium Tier: 5,000+ images/hour
- Latency P50: 20s (good user experience)
- Latency P95: 45s (acceptable for most users)
- Latency P99: 60s (rare delays)
- Cost: $91/month (free tier optimized)
- Uptime: 99.9% (enterprise SLA)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Service Dependencies:**
- Relies on Replicate API availability
- Vendor lock-in potential
- API rate limits and quotas
- Managed service limitations
- Cost scaling with usage

**üéØ Key Benefits to Highlight:**
- ‚úÖ GPU acceleration without infrastructure management
- ‚úÖ Managed services (no DevOps overhead)
- ‚úÖ 99.9% uptime SLA guarantee
- ‚úÖ Automatic scaling and load balancing
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade monitoring included
- ‚úÖ Rapid deployment and updates
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective for moderate usage

### STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, managed-service design
- Clear service boundaries and data flow
- Component specifications visible
- Performance metrics prominently displayed
- Cost information highlighted
- Professional color scheme
- Suitable for technical and business audiences

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
PNG/SVG diagram suitable for technical documentation, with clear labels and professional appearance showing the complete managed services architecture with Replicate API integration.
